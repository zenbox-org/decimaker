# Startup Probability Theory - Draft

## Temporal drift

Imagine Olympic runners. A cameraman is shooting the finish. If the camera's exposition is too high, the resulting image will be blurred. We need to ensure that the object under measure doesn't change during the measurement.

Normally we solve this problem by:

* Stabilizing the object under measure (making sure it doesn't move)
* Increasing the speed of measurement (making sure the instrument takes a snapshot before the object changes)

What if both solutions are not available? There are important practical situations in which both solutions are not available:

* Can't stabilize the stock market
* Can't measure all variables before it changes (can measure only some variables)

Recall the following axioms:

* (LCE) Law of Conservation of Energy: "the total energy of an isolated system remains constant over time"
* (MEE) Mass-Energy Equivalence: "E = mc^2"

According to LCE and MEE, the total mass of an isolated system remains constant over time.

However, we rarely deal with isolated systems. Let's define "explosion" as a thermodynamic process where the mass of an isolated system decreases over time.

Assume that explosion is continuous: given the trajectory of a single mass particle, assume that the particle has been present in every point of this trajectory.

Please note that measurements don't provide us with points: rather, they provide us with spheres where the center of the sphere is the most likely position of the mass particle at the moment when the measurement happened (i.e. the measuring particle got emitted / reflected from the mass particle).
